#######Times Of India | Nov 1, 2015,
when Chandu Harshvardhan, 21, a BTech from Hyderabad, arrived in Bengaluru for his IAS exam, he had no trouble getting around the city. All he did was rent a scooter from a bike rental startup. It was waiting at the railway station when his train reached Bengaluru. ["RoadPanda"](https://www.roadpanda.com) was suggested to me by **Trip Advisor**. I used the Activa to go around the city. After four days, they came and collected it from the station," he says. [RoadPanda](https://www.roadpanda.com), started by exHoneywell employees Abhilash Nair and Vijay Meena, started its operations in July.Its target customers are mainly visitors who need a two-wheeler. It was their troublesome experience with local trains in Mumbai that got them into this business. "In 2013, when I visited Mumbai, travelling was a huge problem. I had to take the local train there. It was quite difficult not having my own vehicle," says Nair.

Customers need to pay a deposit of Rs 2,000 plus the equivalent for the number of hours they intend to use the bike. In Harshvardhan's case, it was just Rs 1,000.
